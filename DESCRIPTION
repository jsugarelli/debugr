Title: Debug Tool to Watch Objects/Expressions While Running an R Script
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Joachim", "Zuckarelli", email = "joachim@zuckarelli.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Maintainer: Joachim Zuckarelli <joachim@zuckarelli.de>
Description: Tool to print out the value of R objects/expressions while running
  an R script. Outputs can be made dependent on user-defined conditions/criteria. 
  Debug messages only appear when a global option for debugging is set. 
  This way, 'debugr' code can even remain in the debugged code for later use 
  without any negative effects during normal runtime.
